**COMPONENTS**
--

**1.	MICROCONTROLLER**

_A microcontroller is needed to perform all the important operations so that the projector works fine._


**2.	SERVO MOTOR**

_It is use to control the flow of water._


**3.	ULTRASONIC DISTANCE SENSOR**

_It is used to sense the distance between itself and the surface of water._


**4.	LEDs**

_LEDs are used to indicate the water level. If the water has crossed the upper limit, green LED will glow. If the water goes below the lower limit, red light will glow.  ._


**5.	POTENTIOMETER**

_It is used in place of water to give the sensor the analog input by adjusting it_


**6.	VOLTAGE SOURCE**

_It is used to give power to the motor and potentiometer._

**7.	GROUND**

_Grounding is used to protect the equipments._
