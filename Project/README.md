**DESCRIBTION**
-
A projector is an optical gadget that projects a picture (or moving images) onto a surface, usually a projection screen. It uses DLP(DIGITAL LIGHT PRECESSING) technology.  It has various communication interfaces and memory interfaces which are used to communicate with devices and transfering data.

**HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-
|Test ID  |    Description  |  
-------------|-----------------------------------
|HL01     |    The projector must project pictures or videos | 
|HL02     |    The projector must have a slot for memory          |
|HL03     |    The projector should be able to connect with PCs wirelessly    |
|HL04     |    The projector must have communication interfaces  |
|HL05     |    The projector must be able to store information or data |
|HL06     |    The projector should be controllable using a RF remote Controller |
|HL07     |    The projector should be able to produce audio |

**LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-
|Test ID   |  Description | 
------------------|-------------------
|LL01     | The projector should have low power consumption |
|LL02     | The picture or video resolution should be of full hd quality for better view|
|LL03     | The user can use USB A, USB C, VGA Port, HDMI for communication purpose |
|LL04     | The projector must not get overheated |

**SWOT ANALYSIS**
-
__STRENGTHS__

- The projector produces large pictures(static or moving) with full hd resolution which is comfortable to ours eyes. Also uses less power. The projector has many communication interfaces(wired as well as wireless).

**WEAKNESSES**

- The projector doesnot run on batteries and runs on main power supply. Thus making it ponderous.  

**OPPORTUNITIES**

- Projection technology continues to evolve and develop in resolution, in ease of use, connectivity, brightness. 

**THREATS**

- The use of mobile phones and laptops may decrease the need of projectors in coming future.

**WHO**

 - This project is purely done by me and whatever happens, I am responsible for that.
 
 **WHAT**
 
 - Projector is important in offices, schools and in places where there is a large crowd . So, I am building a projector which works on DLP(DIGITAL LIGHT PRECESSING) technology.
 
 **WHEN**
 
 - This project has been done between 23 of february 2022 and  of february 2022.
 
 **WHERE**
 
 - I have used **SIMULIDE** to simulate all the parts of the projector and I have also used **ARDUINO IDE** for wrint the code.

**HOW**

- I am doing this project using **Embedded C** language. I have used different sensors in this project.

**APPLICATIONS**
-

1.	 Can be used in schools/offices.
2.	 Can be use to watch movies or videos.
3.	 It can be used in engineering field
