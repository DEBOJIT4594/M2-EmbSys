**COMPONENTS**
-

**1.	MICROCONTROLLER**

_A microcontroller is needed to perform all the important operations so that the projector works fine._


**2.	DISCRETE DEVICES**

_Discrete devices are used to regulate voltages, help lower power consumption, and reduce heat generation._


**3.	STORAGE INTERFACES**

_It is basically used to access secondary storage such as SD card or CD._


**4.	DMA CONTROLLER**

_This allows  I/O devices to directly access memory without involving microcontroller._


**5.	RF REMOTE CONTROLLER**

_It is a device used to control the projector. This device uses Radio Frequency (RF)._


**6.	TEMPERATURE SENSOR**

_This is a sensor which is used to sense temperature._


**7.	SPI**

_Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is used to communicate with PCs wirelessly._


**8.	COMMUNICATION INTERFACES**

_It is used to communicate with other devices for data transfer._


**9.	DIGITAL LIGHT PROCESSING(DLP)**

_It is used to produce pictures and videos_


**10.	AUDIO OUTPUT**

_It is the sound that comes out from the projector._


**11.	EEPROM**

_It is used to store data temporarily._


**12.	HDMI PORT**

_It is basically used to send high quality audio and video from a computer to the projector._
