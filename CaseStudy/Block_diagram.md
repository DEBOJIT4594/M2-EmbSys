**COMPONENTS**
-

**1.	MICROCONTROLLER**

A microcontroller is needed to perform all the important operations so that the projector works fine.


**2.	DISCRETE DEVICES**

Discrete devices are used to regulate voltages, help lower power consumption, and reduce heat generation.


**3.	STORAGE INTERFACES**

It is basically used to access secondary storage such as SD card or CD.


**4.	DMA CONTROLLER**

This allows  I/O devices to directly access memory without involving microcontroller.


**5.	RF REMOTE CONTROLLER**

It is a device used to control the projector. This device uses Radio Frequency (RF).


**6.	TEMPERATURE SENSOR**

This is a sensor which is used to sense temperature.


**7.	SPI**

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is used to communicate with PCs wirelessly.


**8.	COMMUNICATION INTERFACES**

It is used to communicate with other devices for data transfer.


**9.	DIGITAL LIGHT PROCESSING(DLP)**

It is used to produce pictures and videos


**10.	AUDIO OUTPUT**

It is the sound that comes out from the projector.


**11.	EEPROM**

It is used to store data temporarily.


**12.	HDMI PORT**

It is basically used to send high quality audio and video from a computer to the projector.
